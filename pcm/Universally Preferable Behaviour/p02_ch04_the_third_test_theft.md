## The Third Test: Theft

We will have to spend a little bit more time on theft, since it inevitably brings into the picture the question of property rights, which is highly contentious for some.

There are many ways of approaching the question of property rights, from “homesteading” to legal definitions to practical considerations etc. I will address none of those here, because the question of property rights must fall into the framework of UPB, if UPB is to stand as a rational methodology for evaluating moral propositions.

Clearly, the moral proposition with regard to property rights is this: either human beings have the right to own property, or they do not.

Now the first “property” that must be dealt with is the body. “Ownership” must first and foremost consist of control over one’s own body, because if that control does not exist, or is not considered valid, then the whole question of morality – let alone property – goes out the window.

UPB is a framework for evaluating moral propositions, or arguments about universally preferable behaviour for all mankind. First and foremost, a man must be responsible for his own actions if they are to be judged morally, since as we have argued above, the capacity to choose actions is fundamental to any ethical evaluation.

If a man has no control over his body, then clearly he has no responsibility for his actions – they are not in fact “his” actions, but rather the actions of his body. Now, no one would rationally argue that if a man strangles another man, it is the murderous fingers that should be put on trial and punished. Clearly, the body cannot entirely control itself, but rather must be to some degree under the direction of the conscious mind.

What this means is that a man is responsible for the actions of his body, and therefore he is responsible for the *effects* of those actions. A man is responsible for where he puts his penis, which is how we know that we can judge him for raping someone. He “owns” the actions of his body as surely as he owns his body. To say that a man is responsible for his body but not the effects of his body is to argue that a man is responsible for aiming and throwing a knife, but not for where it lands.

Also, arguing that a man is not responsible for the effects of his body is a self-detonating statement, similar to the ones we examined above. If I say to you: “Men are not responsible for the actions of their bodies,” it would be eminently fair for you to ask me who is working my vocal chords and mouth. If I say that I have no control over my speech – which is an effect of the body – then I have “sustained” my thesis at the cost of invalidating it completely.

If I am not at all responsible for my speech, then there is no point arguing with me. A tape recorder is also not responsible for its speech, which is why we tend not to get into virulent disagreements with magnetic strips. In cheesy horror films, young girls seem to be particularly susceptible to demonic possession – the inevitable priest who shows up always offers to talk to the demon in charge of the girl, at which point the girl starts making a sound like Don Ho gargling with ball bearings.

This ridiculous portrait is accurate in one sense though – if some other being is in full control of the girl’s vocal chords, it is that being which needs to be addressed, not the girl, who has no control over her responses.

Thus if I say to you that I do not have control over my speech, you can ask me: who does? If I reply that no one does, then it makes about as much sense to argue with me as it does to argue with a television set, or the aforementioned boulder as it bounces down a hillside towards you car.

Thus the very act of controlling my body to produce speech demands the acceptance of my ability to control my speech – an implicit affirmation of my ownership over my own body.

Now, if demonic possession were a valid occurrence, and a girl possessed by a demon spat on a priest, we would not call the *girl* rude, but would rather pity her for being inhabited by such an impolite demon. Whoever has control over the girl’s body is culpable for the effects of her actions – this is why we would not call a man who stole while sleepwalking “evil,” since he did not have full control over his own body (although we may restrain him in other ways). This is also the basis for the legal defence of “not guilty by reason of insanity,” which is that we assume that a man who is insane does not have full control over his actions.

Thus to reject the ownership of the body is to reject all morality, which, as we have seen above, is utterly impossible. Logically, since morality is defined as an enforceable subset of UPB, to reject morality is to say that it is universally preferable to believe that there is no such thing as universal preferences.

Finally, to use one’s ownership of one’s own body in the form of speech to reject the notion that one can control one’s own body, is a blatant and insurmountable self-contradiction.

It is in this way that any rejection of self-ownership can be utterly discarded.

Since we own our bodies, we also inevitably own the *effects* of our actions, be they good or bad. If we own the effects of our actions, then clearly we own that which we produce, whether what we produce is a bow, or a book – or a murder.

### Property And UPB

Even if we reject the above, we can still use UPB to definitively assert the existence of universal property rights.

As mentioned above, either human beings have property rights, or they do not. Except for a few grey areas, which we will get to shortly, this remains a universal proposition.

If a man does not have the right to use property, then he does not have the right to use his own body. He does not have the right to use his own lungs, and therefore must stop breathing. Although this sounds silly, it is an immediate and inevitable result of the premise that human beings do not have property rights.

It is fairly safe to assume that anyone you are debating property rights with is drawing breath, and thus agrees with you that he has the right to use his own body at least.

The question then comes up whether or not human beings have the right to *exclusive* property use. For instance, property could be defined as a sort of time-share principle of ownership, insofar as everyone should have the right to own everything, on some schedule or another.

This means of course that a man with lung cancer has a right to at least one lung of a healthy person. Since all ownership starts with the body, if we do not have the right to exclusive ownership over our own body, then we must share our body with other people, or be immoral. The sick man has a right to one of our lungs, and if we withhold it from him, that is exactly the same as stealing it. Similarly, both you and I have the right to use Celine Dion’s singing voice, since it is wholly selfish of her to pretend that she has exclusive ownership of it.

If human beings do not possess exclusive ownership over their own bodies, then the crime of rape becomes meaningless, since a woman clearly does not exclusively own her vagina, and neither does a man own his own various orifices. If exclusive self-ownership is not an axiom, then even the crime of murder becomes meaningless.

It is no crime to commit suicide, any more than it is to set fire to your own house, since the destruction of one’s own property is a valid exercise of ownership. However, if exclusive self-ownership is invalid, then there can be no distinction between murder and suicide. If my liver is failing, and I have a right to take yours, then I can “repossess” it in perfect accordance with morality and honourable behaviour. If this procedure kills you, so what? Without exclusive self-ownership, there is no “you” to begin with…

Thus we can reasonably say that exclusive self-ownership is a basic reality – that all human beings at all times and in all places have exclusive ownership over their own bodies, and thus have exclusive ownership over the effects of their own bodies, both in terms of moral behaviour and property creation or acquisition.

### The Grey Areas

Naturally, any statement such as the above brings the inevitable howls of “complexity,” which I fully agree with.

Let us say that I mean to give you five dollars as a gift, but by mistake I hand you a ten dollar bill, saying, “This is for you.” Few people would consider it theft if I said, the moment after I handed it to you: “Sorry, I meant to give you five dollars, not ten,” and took the larger note back, even though I am taking back property that I have voluntarily relinquished.

On the other extreme, if you are one of my sons, and I pay for your university education, and explicitly tell you that you never need to pay me back, my generosity will doubtless affect your spending habits. It would scarcely seem reasonable for me to clap my forehead after your graduation ceremony and cry, “Oh, I thought you were one of my *other* sons!” and demand repayment.

Similarly, it is generally accepted that children cannot enter into legal contracts, but that adults can. In many societies, the differentiating age is eighteen years. This means, of course, that at the stroke of midnight between a man’s seventeenth year and eighteenth birthday, his capacity to enter into legal contracts arrives fully formed. Has he gone through some massive biological transformation in that split second? Certainly not, although at eighteen he is biologically very different than he was at the age of ten, both in terms of physical and mental development.

For the sake of efficiency, if not perfect morality, arbitrary transitions are often placed between one state and another. Childhood is definitely one state; adulthood is quite another. The transition between childhood and adulthood is blended; it is not black and white, but rather like the day descending into dusk, and then night. Noon is definitely not night, and midnight is definitely not daytime, but there are times in between when it is harder to tell, although the direction of the transition is always clear.

In the same way, a man who is greatly mentally deficient can be considered far less responsible for his own actions. A man with an IQ of sixty-five is mentally scarcely more than a little child – a man with an IQ of one hundred is an average adult. If we say that a man with an IQ of eighty becomes responsible, then we are by definition saying that a man with an IQ of seventy-nine is not responsible – is that a clear, fair, and utterly objective demarcation? Certainly not, but in order for most concepts to be practical, the criterion of “good enough” and a reasonable cost/benefit analysis must be put into place. As mentioned above, no water is perfectly pure, but waiting for perfect purity would simply cause a man to die of thirst.

Given that the question of moral responsibility and intellectual capacity only applies to a very small percentage of people right on the border, and that creating objective and perfect tests is very likely to prove impossible, there will inevitably be some “rules of thumb” that win the day. We can only assume that, since biologists live with this kind of occasional subjectivism every day, moral philosophers can somehow survive as well.

### Property As Universality

UPB thus gives us clear options with regards to property rights. It cannot be the case that some men have property rights, while other men do not. It cannot be the case that men in Washington have property rights, while women in Baltimore do not. It cannot be the case that men have property rights today, but not tomorrow, and so on.
How that one dey work for practise

If I get two lawnmowers and you nor get even one, then e dey logical  for you to get the right to collect one of my lawnmower, since na only half of my lawnmower collection I suppose get.

however, when you make one of my lawnmowers your own, na only half of the lawnmower you suppose ever get, since all of us only get right to fifty percent ownership of things wey nor be part of our body. So na must for you to find person quick quick wey go follow you share the lawnmower. after na just twenty five percent go be your own. However the other person nor fit also get twenty five percent of the lawnmower cos na just fifty percent right wey him get over the things wey be him own – so him too must find person wey go collect fifty percent of wetin him get – and na so the thing go continue dey go.

D problem with any theory wey argue say people nor suppose get hundred percent right of ownership be say e dey instantly cause "domino effect" of strong regression way be say last last every body get only small ownership right over almost everytin, and that one nor fit happen. So e must happen – say both logically and practically we get complete ownership over our own body and over the thing wey our body do, when you dey talk of external property. we nor need theory of homesteading or just acquisition way of approach to show say property rights dey pure – we know say e pure already cos anybody wey fit behave as him like – even who dey follow argue – don already start to flex him own hundred percent control on top him own body, even on top homesteading plus including oxygen and sound to make him own case.

So as we join UPB with reality as everybody see am, e nor go hard us to understand say since anybody wey dey follow argue property rights dey flex hundred percent control on top him own property, the only question wey we fit ask, na whether property right dey different for different people or not – this na question wey the true tori of self-ownership and the UPB framework don answer already. wetin dey good or bad suppose be as everybody think am and na so we go take sabi say everybody get hundred percent property right.

naturally e nor dey possible make things happen another way.

### we dey test "Theft"

make we go back to our innocent guinea pig dem, Bob and Doug.

If theft na good thing, then the problem wey be say one person no fit get be good and bad the same time na him dey our front so. If Bob get lighter, and stealing nor be bad thing, then Doug must nab Bob lighter. However, that time wey Doug dey nab Bob lighter, we nor fit say Bob him self dey do good thing. After Doug nab Bob lighter, Bob must nab him lighter back. as e be so, na only stealing if the lighter nor be Bob own in the first place. When Doug nab the lighter, e nor fit become Doug legit property just like that, cos if na so then wetin theft mean no make sense. If the time I nab person thing, e don become my legit property, then if I return am the person too don nab my thing . So if as I nab Bob lighter e nor fit be my legit property, then e nor dey possible for Bob to nab the lighter back, cos we nor fit nab wetin me our own, and as I nab am e never change the fact say na Bob get the lighterlighter.

And na so wey if stealing na good thing, then the only way Doug go fit arrange as good person na when him nab Bob lighter.  that time na only Doug fit be good person but Bob no fit. but after none of them fit say them good, unless Doug continue to return the lighter back to Bob, after him nab am then nab am again.

ofcos e funny to imagine say the better way to behave na for one man to continue to dey nab wetin him return after him nab am. And logic dey try to make us understand say the thing nor make sense for anybody to behave like that. – But make we still waka go front for this matter, make we see wetin we go find. 

No forget sey nor be thief people dem be the matter we dey discuss now, but na the tori wey tok say violation of property rights make sense.  Just imagine say Doug nab Bob light cos Doug believe  say "property right nor dey valid" then the idea wey Doug get on top wetin good or bad go don cast.

if property rights nor dey valid, then pata pata stealing na something wey nor make sense, since stealing na just the legit way wey people dey use control their property.

Property rights themsef na just the ways wey people choose to hold control of their asset them. e nor be must, as far as say you and me fit join one hippie commune ,come decide to never use our property rights again. Or if them come sabi for my neighborhood say e dey sweet me if person take my property. e mean say my lawnmower go soon loss. And so if I write "take am if you like am" on top my laptop come put am for front of my house. den e dey clear say I dey try tell people say I nor want to dey in control of the laptop again.

If Doug nab Bob lighter, na cos Doug wan colonize the lighter – wey be the real meaning of property rights. If Doug nab Bob lighter cos Doug believe say property rights nor dey valid, then wetin him really mean be say " I wan dey colonize Bob lighter cos e nor make sense to  colonize anything at all".

If Doug come nab Bob lighter, and Doug come reject property right just to defend himsef. Then e mean say Doug nor go fit stop Bob from collecting him lighter back – since property right nor dey valid. Now Doug nor go fit yarn say na him get the lighter, but Bob go fit. Last last, If Doug nab the lighter cos  "stealing na good" then e clear sey Doug nor go fit do anytin if another person nab the lighter. e go make small sense if anoda person nab the lighter from Doug hand after Doug don spend time and energy nab the lighter finish. Wetin the tori mean be say for person to try to control any property, e go make sense if that person go fit get property right over the things wey him nab. Man pikin nor go waste time to nab wallet if him sabi say anoda man go nab am from him hand later.

to put am anoda way, stealing na affirmation and na also denial of property rights. Any tori of wetin good or bad wey support stealing, dey affirm and dey also deny property rights – this one na contradiction wey don make the tori cast.

If we look the side of wetin good or bad for communism, for instance, we go see say e deny property right for people.  However, na only those people wey call themsef "the government"dey get right to control property dem. wetin this one mean be say  e nor good make some men control property but e good for other men to control property. since biological difference nor dey between person wey dey rule and the people wey him dey rule. now e don clear for us to see say, for the same people,  we get rules for wetin good and wetin bad wey no blend at all, and e nor fit dey valid. UPB dey talk say make the moral rule dey the same for every body, for every where and every time. To talk say e nor pure for Ivan Denisovich to flex him moral rights – but e pure for Joseph Stalin to flex him moral right – go make ranking to cast, Wey no different from the tori wey say to pour water for inside pool go empty am and e go also full am the same time. Them go use laugh end the career of any physicist wey tell people that kind tori – moralist sha dey always tell people the other tori and peopl dey always cut cap for them.
It also cannot be the case that men have only fifty percent property rights.

If I argue: “Men only have fifty percent property rights,” then I create yet another insurmountable contradiction. You may well ask me which half of my sentence was *not* generated by me. If I only have fifty percent property rights, then clearly I only have fifty percent control over my own body – if I put forward the above sentence, then clearly I am only in control of fifty percent of that sentence, since I only have fifty percent control over my voice. Who, then, is responsible for the other fifty percent of my sentence?

This may sound esoteric, but it is a deadly serious question, for reasons that we will get to shortly.

Let us say that we can somehow magically bypass the “fifty percent ownership of the body” problem, and say that human beings only have fifty percent property rights when it comes to *external* objects.
